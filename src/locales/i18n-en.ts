## 🖌️ Edit

- Select Identity: The first four options are "**Teacher**," "**Story Event**," "**Reply**," and "**System Message**." The last button is used to **add custom characters**.
- For Teachers/Students, clicking on the avatar sends in-game **chat stickers** and **student face variations images**.
- You can use [a syntax similar to markdown](https://github.com/U1805/momotalk/blob/main/docs/How-to-use.md#%EF%B8%8F-%E7%BC%96%E8%BE%91%E6%B6%88%E6%81%AF--edit-messages) to send some special text styles.
